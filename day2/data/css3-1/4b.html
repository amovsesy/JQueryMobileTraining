At the time of writing this article, Google Chrome has the only working implementation of the FileSystem API. A dedicated browser UI does not yet exist for file/quota management. To store data on the user's system, may require your app to request quota. However, for testing, Chrome can be run with the --unlimited-quota-for-files flag. Furthermore, if you're building an app or extension for the Chrome Web Store, the unlimitedStorage manifest file permission can be used in place of requesting quota. Eventually, users will receive a permission dialog to grant, deny, or increase storage for an app.
